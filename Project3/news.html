                    <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</h2>
                    <p>DJ-producer Alan Walker discovered that he belonged to the world of music at the age of 14. The 21-year-old Norwegian, whose latest track On My Way has proved to be a big hit, is a self-taught musician. If his track Fade gave him recognition, Faded upped the ante further. He acknowledges the fact that his career has also allowed him to realise some of his far-fetched dreams.
                        In an exclusive chat with BT, the man behind the mask talks about life on the road, what he misses the most, the music that’s true to his self and being grateful to his fans in India for their support. Read on…</p>
                    <p class="hidePart">You were in Mumbai recently, what brought you to the city?
                        I was in Mumbai for a musical event and a special performance. It was pretty exciting. My cameraman did a lot of research (smiles). We took a rickshaw ride and saw paintings of famous Bollywood actresses. I got to see a little bit of Mumbai and experience the culture that is prevalent here.
                        At the age of 21, you have your track, On My Way, topping music charts…
                        To be honest, it feels amazing. It’s really fun to be able to turn your hobby into work. It has been four-five years (since my music career took off), and it’s been crazy and a lot of fun. Music has brought me to places that I couldn’t have afforded to visit or ever thought of coming to... one of them is Mumbai. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to come here and spread happiness and love through music.
                        You are a self-taught musician. Why did you turn to the online medium to learn music?
                        These days everything is available easily on the internet. You find thousands of tutorials on everything from changing the tyres of your car to making a song. When I developed an interest in music, I got in touch with some people online. They guided me and asked me to watch tutorials. I did that and eventually started my career.
                        While growing up, you had self-esteem issues. How has music instilled confidence in you?
                        I wasn’t sure where I wanted to go.I was just 17 when I had my first breakthrough. It has been quite a journey, but at the same time, I was unsure of what I wanted to do. There was music on one side, but I was also going to school. So, it was a matter of making decisions. When my songs did well, my father gave me the option to quit school, but it was also about deciding what would be best for me. It was a big risk to quit school, but now that I think about it, I realise that I could have ended up in the military, or a music school in America or at a nearby grocery store (laughs!).
                        You were busy making music and touring at an early age, do you feel like you missed on growing up like a normal teenager?
                        I feel like I missed out on being at home and with my friends. That’s something most people (from the world of music) can identify with. I do around 180 shows a year and am always travelling. It is the determination (to excel in music) that makes you miss out on a lot of things. It is work and it is important to maintain your product lifelong.
                        In one of your earlier interviews, you expressed your desire to enter the ‘pop world’, but you are happy doing EDM...
                        I am at a stage where I am trying to explore more of pop music and be a popular artiste (laughs!). There are many genres – like Reggae — that I incorporate into my music. For example, my song Waves is different from what I usually do.
                        Is that working for you?
                        Yes, it is. But I would also like to make music that I feel is true to myself and not just about what’s popular and sounds good on the radio. I want to make songs that I would like to listen to, even though they may not be always on the top.
                        You must be aware of the fact that your music has struck a chord with music lovers in India…
                        I have been receiving a lot of love and support from my Indian fans and that’s remarkable. I wouldn’t have been here without the support of my fans. I am always grateful to have the opportunity to travel all around the world and meet so many wonderful people. My message to my fans is that if you ever feel like you are alone, that’s not true; there is always someone there to support you.
                        We hear that like other international artistes, you too, are planning to collaborate with an Indian performer...
                        Things are happening, but I cannot tell you about it. But yes, many exciting collaborations will come up this year.
                        Are we talking about Bollywood music here?
                        Well, music in general (smiles!).
